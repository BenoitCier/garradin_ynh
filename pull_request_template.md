## Problem
- Upgrade to the version 1.0.2

## Solution
- BenoitCier found a solution in his Pull Request https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/garradin_ynh/pull/32
- I have added also a line for the script upgrade to put the file Utils.php in place to debug this version with Yunohost (perhaps it is temporally for this uniq version ?).
